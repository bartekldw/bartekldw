hey there 👋  
I'm Bartek — a high school student diving deep into C++ and low-level stuff.  
I love physics (both real-world and simulated), and I’m currently learning SFML and OpenGL.
Building physics engines from scratch is my kind of fun - forces, collisions, and all that nerdy beauty of physics.

My dream is to become a low-level graphics programme*, working with Vulkan, OpenGL, and everything close to the metal.
