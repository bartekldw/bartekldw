# hey there 👋  
I'm Bartek — a high school student diving deep into C++ and low-level stuff.  
Building physics engines from scratch is my kind of fun - forces, collisions, and all that nerdy beauty of physics.
My dream is to become a low-level graphics programmer, working with Vulkan, OpenGL, and everything close to the metal.  
Btw, I love Linux and I use Arch 🐧
